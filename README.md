Battery holder PCB for Psion Organiser II RAM packs

This is a PCB that can be attached to a Psion Organiser II RAM pack in place of the soldered in battery that was originally fitted. It has a 2032 type battery holder mounted on it that holds a 2032 battery. This makes the battery easily replaceable, much easier than unsoldering the original, sourcing a battery that will fit the PCB and soldering that in.

You will need to find a battery holder that fits the PCB footprint. The ones I found were actually through-hole parts but it's easy to bend the tabs and turn them into surface mount. They are also too big to fit in the standard datapack case so I had to sand away the sides until they fitted using a disc sander.

Fitting the PCB isn't the easiest of tasks, due to a number of difficulties.

Here's a rough sequence:

1. Test that the RAM pack still works. battery leakage can cause corrosion that destroys the tracks on the PCB and even the ICs
2. Fix the RAM pack if possible. If it still doesn't work then it's the end of the pack...

3. Cut the original battery off    (easy)
4. Clear the battery wire holes of solder (hard)
   I've used a vacuum desoldering tool for this, but it's still difficult to do for some reason.
5. Solder wires into the PCB holes
6. File, sand, cut the wire and solder that sits under the battery. This joint needs to be perfectly smooth otherwise the battery won't slide into the holder. Unfortunately you have to reheat this joint when soldering the PCB on the datapack so either solder that joint quickly or fit the battery holder after filing. If you fit after filing though, be careful not to get filing over the PCBs as it is conductive.
7. Place modified battery holder on PCB and solder it. Soilder the joints quickly to avoid melting the first joints or the wires will fall out of the PCB and you have to start again.
8 Check battery slides into holder
9. Check case fits.
10. Check RAM pack works and retains contenets after removed from organiser.

It's involved and quite time consuming but it can be done. There's videos here:
